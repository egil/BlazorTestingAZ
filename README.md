# Blazor-testing from A to Z - deme solution

This is the demo solution from my talk **Blazor-testing from A to Z**:

> This session will discuss and showcase the different Blazor testing strategies, libraries, and tools available to us, so whether you are building a website, web app, or a reusable Blazor component library, you can pick the ones that yield the most bang for the buck.
> 
> Specifically, this session covers end-2-end testing, component testing, unit testing, Playwright, bUnit, snapshot testing, semantic markup comparison, emulating user interactions, and how and when to use test doubles (e.g., mocks).
> 
> We will cover these topics with the goal of creating tests that protect against regressions, are resistant to refactoring, are maintainable, and give fast feedback.
